# Visual Perception, Part I

In this lecture, we will focus on visual perception, because most information that we receive in general is conveyed visually and that's especially true when we're talking about graphical user interfaces.

- **How we take in information about the world**
    - Sight 
    - Hearing 
    - Touch 
    - Smell 
    - Taste 
    - and a few others...

 Saccades or sequential eye fixations are how we pick up information from a lot of static images like pages of text or web pages that we perceive online.

People don't necessarily read all parts of web pages equally.

What's been shown through a series of studies mostly performed by Jakob Nielsen, is that people tend to follow an F shaped reading pattern when looking at different types of web pages. 

What's being show is a heat map showing how people read pages on the web. 


### Principles 

- **Make important info & actions visible** 
    - information that is not immediately visible and perceivable by users, is less likely to be noticed and if extra effort is required to find it, the number of users that will find it and take action on it is going to be reduced significantly.

- **Leverage "the read"**

- **When evaluation, ask yourself "did they see it?"**
