## UX Design Overview Lecture

What is design?
: A design is a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a purpose.

**Design is:**
- A Plan

- **Arranging Elements** -  Arranging elements and those elements will depend on the type of product that it is. 

- **Purpose** - a purpose that this design is supposed to accomplish, and is supposed to help the users or the consumers of the design to accomplish, and ultimately a design is mostly about how it works and the functionality and not just about how it looks.


###_The Design Process_

**The brake down**
- Understand the problem - Assess
- Generate possible solutions - Design 
- Analyze and select - End of Day 
- Embody solutions - Build 
- Assess (find new problems) - Assess (repeat)


**What is special about UX Design?**
- Experiences are interactive 
- Time based
- Action - response rules 
- Action: command options 
- Response: information presentation 
- Complex system behavior (Focus on usability)

**Context is critical** 
- Other interactions 
- Other activities

###_Prototyping_

**Why prototype?** 

- Reification 
- Reflection 
- Communication 
- Assessment 


**Economic principle of prototyping** 

The best prototype is the one that in the simplest and most efficient way, makes the possibilities of a design idea visible and measurable 

**The main reason why we progress through different levels of prototyping are:** 

**Premature commitment** 
- Investing resources (time, money) in a dead end
- Problems
- Waste money and effort 
- Exhaust project resources timeline, stuck with a bad design 
- Cognitive and emotional commitments hard undo


Lo-fi Prototyping

###_Sketching_ 

**What is a sketch?**
: A cheap rapidly contracted representation of an idea. 

**Qualities of a sketch** 
- Quick 
- Timely 
- Inexpensive 
- Disposable 
- Plentiful 
- Minimal detail 
- Allow ambiguity 

**Why Sketch?** 
- Reflect 
- Explore 
- Communicate 

How to Sketch 

**What to Sketch** 

- The problem 
    - How would someone experience this problem 
- The Solution 
   - What would it look like for the problem to be solved? 
   - How would a system help solve the problem? 

**Generation** 
- Sketch! 
- Quantity over quality 
- Build, don't critique 
- Apply lateral thing 


**Sketcher's Block: Ideation**
- You will run out of ideas. Don't stop!
- Many techniques exist for "lateral thinking" 
    - Brainstorming 
    - Matrix techniques eg. Morphological analysis 

**Ideation technique: The worst idea** 
- Use when stuck - Think of the worst idea(s) you can for solving the problem
