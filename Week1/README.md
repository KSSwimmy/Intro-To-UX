**What is User Experience?**

### The UX Process 

**Fail Fast**
- You won't get it right the first time. 
- Get it wrong and quickly as possible 
- Learn from mistakes 
- Get it less wrong

**_Interactive Design Consists of 3 Phases_**

**ASSESS -**  assessment phase, initially, what we're doing is we're assessing what users are currently doing and what their needs are so that we can understand the design space and the problems that they're facing so that we can design products that will address those needs.

**DESIGN -** In the design phase, we take what we've learned in the initial assessment and come up with ideas, lots of ideas for how we might deliver a product that solves the problem that we've identified in the assessment. 

**BUILD -** In the build phase, we take those design ideas or a subset of those design ideas and we build them into prototypes or some representation that we can use to communicate a particular idea, so that we can then use it to get feedback on whether that idea is headed in the right direction or in the wrong direction.


**Key Methods: UX Research**
- Interviews
- Observation
- Surveys
- User Testing
- Inspection

**Key Methods: UX Design**
- Personas, scenarios, user stories
- Sketching and Ideation 
- Mapping and Navigation Design
- Comparative Research 
- Lo, Mid, and Hi - Fidelity Prototyping

**Understand how people work**
- What can people perceive? 
    - How do people extract info from visual stimuli? 
- How do people do things? 
    - How do people decide how to act in the world and how do they process information about the results of their actions? 
- How does emotion pay a role? 
    - How when and why does emotion effect decision making and what role does emotion play in user experience?
