# WEEK 4: How do people act in the world?

## The 7 Stages of Action

![DOET](Week4Images/DOET.png "DOET")
The aurthor of "The Design of Everyday Things" Don Norman created the concept of the 7 Stages of Action

The 7 Stages of Action Explained

1. It starts with the user or the person forming a goal, so forming a goal about something that they want to accomplish.

2. Then, proceeds to forming a specific intention to act towards pursuing that goal.

3. Given that intention, the user or the individual then selects an action of the set of actions that are possible in the environment where they are currently located, and then proceeds to execute the action.

4. In executing the action, the person changes the world or changes the environment in some way to hopefully move them closer to their goal. 

5. So, the next step is actually to perceive the change that they've made in the world.

6. Perceive the world as it is now after their action and interpret the state of the world.

7. To try to figure out, did they actually succeed in moving closer towards their goal? Or did their action not get them closer to their goal? In either case, they would then update their goal either moving onto the next step, the next goal that they want to accomplish or forming a new goal that would help them do what they need to do.

So, using these seven stages of action, we can take users interactions with a system that we designed and break them down into smaller steps that make it easier to see where problems might be occurring. By doing that, we can get better insight into what we need to do to fix those problems, so they won't occur in the future.

## Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation

Bridging the Gulfs

- Understand 
    - Users' goals
    - How they thing about accomplishing them 

If we understand users goals, what it is that they're trying to accomplish with the system, and how they think about accomplishing them, we can make sure that the actions that they need to take and expect to be there will be visible and available.


- Make sure likely actions are 
    - Visible when needed 
    - Make sense 

So, we need to make sure that the likely actions, the things that people are likely to do are visible when they're needed and that they make sense.

- Make sure the results of action 
    - Are visible 
    - Make sense

We also need to make sure that the results of their actions are visible and that they make sense.

![tgoe](Week4Images/tgoe.png "The Gulf of Execution")
the gulf of execution as being the challenge that a user faces when trying to map their goals onto the possibilities that are in the world, and selecting appropriate actions that will help them accomplish their goals.   

 ![tgoev](Week4Images/tgoev.png "The Gulf of Evaluation")
Gulf of evaluation, and that is the gulf that uses face when trying to interpret the state of the world to determine whether their actions were successful and whether they moved them closer to meeting their goals.
