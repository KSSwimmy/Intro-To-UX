# WEEK 6: _Heuristic Evaluation and Course Wrap Up_

### Heuristic Evaluation

A Discount UX Research method 
- It's cheap
- Fast 
- No users! 

An "inspection" method
- A systematic "close read" of a user interface
- Apply heuristics 

**How it works**
- Choose a set of screens/interactions for focus 
- Step through, applying heuristics to find potential problems 
    - Be sure to test error cases
    - Be sure to look at help system (if any)
- Write down all violations, big and small 
    - And the heuristics they violate 
- Assess the severity of each problem
- Create prioritized list of problem to fix

**Assessing Severity** 
1 = cosmetic problem: no real usability impact 
2 = minor usability problem; fix if there is time 
3 = major usability problem; important to  fix 
4 = usability catastrophe; imperative to fix

Above is a rating scale that's often used in heuristic evaluation that's just a four-point rating scale, ranging from one, which represents a cosmetic problem, no real usability impact, so something that's maybe just annoying, to four, which is a usability catastrophe, absolutely imperative to fix, because users will not be able to make successful use of the system if that problem isn't fixed.

So, here's an example of the kind of problem that you can find with a heuristic evaluation and how you might communicate that to the designer of a system so they will know what needs to be fixed and how to fix it.
